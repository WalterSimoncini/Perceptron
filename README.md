# Perceptron

Two simple perceptron implementations:

- AND function classifier
- Generic linear function classifier

The linear function classifier can be run in verbose mode (default) or in non-verbose mode, in which only the perceptron's accuracy on the validation data set will be printed. This second mode is particularly useful for analyzing the perceptron's behavior based on the input data sets (training and validation)

### Requirements

In case you want to recreate the charts in the `charts` folder you might have to install the libraries listed in `requirements.txt`. No libraries should be needed for running the perceptron implementation. The program should work with both python 2.x and python 3.x
